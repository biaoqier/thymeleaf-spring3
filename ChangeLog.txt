2.0.15
======
- Made "beans" context variable not override a variable with the same name, if such variable comes
  from the model.


2.0.14
======
- Refactored SpelEvaluationContext to act as a decorator (requirement for thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity3).


2.0.13
======
- (No changes)


2.0.12
======
- Fixed "viewClass" property in ThymeleafViewResolver requiring an implementation of
  ThymeleafView instead of AbstractThymeleafView.
- Added AjaxEnabledView interface for views that include an "ajaxHandler" property.


2.0.11
======
- Add "getFragmentSpec()" / "setFragmentSpec(IFragmentSpec)" methods to ThymeleafView in order to 
  allow the processing of "partial" views (only the template fragments selected by the IFragmentSpec 
  will be processed and rendered).
- Add AJAX-enabled AjaxThymeleafViewResolver and AjaxThymeleafView, making use of an AjaxHandler 
  instance from Spring JS (part of Spring Webflow).
- Add AJAX-enabled FlowAjaxThymeleafView, for Spring WebFlow integration.


2.0.10
======
- (No changes)


2.0.9
=====
- Added RequestContext variable to Model as AbstractTemplateView.SPRING_MACRO_REQUEST_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE
  besides thymeleaf's own SpringContextVariableNames.SPRING_REQUEST_CONTEXT for better compatibility
  with other view-layer technologies.
- Added an HttpServletResponse parameter to SpringWebContext constructors in order to be able to access
  response from processors.
- Refactored SpringEL expression evaluation.
- Added "viewClass" property to ThymeleafViewResolver.


2.0.8
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.7
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.6
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.5
=====
- Modified ViewResolver so that view beans are only configured using an existing bean as prototype
  if this bean is of type ThymeleafView.
- Made ThymeleafView return the default content type in getContentType() even if setContentType()
  has not been called before. This allows compatibility with the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver
  view resolver appeared in Spring 3.0.
- Improved javadoc for ThymeleafViewResolver and ThymeleafView.


2.0.4
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.3
=====
- Modified behaviour of th:method in <form> tags so that it controls whether the selected method
  is supported by browsers (get, post) or not. If not, it creates a hidden input field inside the
  form (named '_method') with the original value and sets the method to 'post'. This mirrors the
  behaviour of Spring's FormTag class (Spring taglib's "<form:form>" tag).
- Added "excludedViewNames" property to ThymeleafViewResolver so that a set of patterns of views
  that will not be resolved by this ViewResolver can be specified. This will act as an 'exclusions'
  filter for what is specified at the "viewNames" property.


2.0.2
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.1
=====
- Fixed incorrect exception messages.


2.0.0
=====
- Created version "3" of the standard DTDs for XHTML template validation, including the
  new th:switch and th:case attributes. 
- Adapted processors to the new DOM/IProcessor infrastructure.


1.1.4
=====
- Solved bug regarding evaluation of the same SpEL expression two times over two objects
  of different classes. Spring AST infrastructure was caching PropertyAccessors and this
  caused ClassCastExceptions. This error appeared on 1.1.3 because of the introduction of
  SpEL expression caching.
  

1.1.3
=====
- Modified SpringWebContext constructors so that they require now the ServletContex 
  object. This enables Thymeleaf to operate without depending at all
  on creating an HTTP session object for the user executing the template.
- Created cache for SpEL evaluation and optimized use of SpEL contexts.


1.1.2
=====
- Fixed: potential case-sensitivity problem in select tags.
- Fixed: bad initialization of th:field on option tags contained within <optgroup>


1.1.1
=====
- Fixed: avoid non-minimizable tags like <script>, <textarea>, <div>, etc. to be
  minimized (appear as <script />, <textarea />, div /> without an end tag).


1.1.0
=====
- Deprecated IValueProcessor interface and related all infrastructure. 
- Created new versions (v2) of the set of thymeleaf-spring3-specific XHTML DTDs, including 
  the new "th:substituteby" attribute:
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-strict-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-transitional-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-frameset-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml11-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
